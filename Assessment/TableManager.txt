writing a Java program that performs basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and interacts with a user interface (UI) form for input.
1. Overall Structure
2. User Interaction
3. Switch Statement
4. CRUD Methods
Add Record 
Update Record
Delete Record
Get Record 
5.  Data Storage Using (HashMap)
7. Input and Output

1. Class Definition and Initialization:
public class TableManager {
    private static Map<Integer, String> table = new HashMap<>();

Explanation
=> Here, you define the TableManager class, which will manage our records.
=>You also initialize a static HashMap called table to store the records, where each record is associated with a unique integer ID (Integer) and a string value (String).

2. Main Method:
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
    int choice;

Explanation:
=> The main method is the entry point of your program.
=> You initialize a Scanner object to read user input from the console.
=> A variable choice is declared to capture the user's menu selection.

3. Menu Loop:
do {
    System.out.println("\n1. Add Record");
    // Other menu options...
    choice = scanner.nextInt();
    scanner.nextLine(); 

Explanation:
=> A do-while loop is used to repeatedly display the menu until the user decides to exit.
=> The menu offers options to add, update, delete, or retrieve a record, or to exit the program.
=> User input is captured using scanner.nextInt() for numerical choices, and scanner.nextLine() to handle the input correctly.

4.Switch-Case for Menu Choices: 
	switch (choice) {
    case 1 -> addRecord(scanner);
    // Other cases...

Explanation:
=>  A switch statement is used to handle different user choices.
=>  Depending on the user’s input, a corresponding method (addRecord, =>  updateRecord, etc.) is called to perform the action.

5. Add Record:
private static void addRecord(Scanner scanner) {
    int id = scanner.nextInt();
    scanner.nextLine();
    String record = scanner.nextLine();
    table.put(id, record);
Explanation:
=>  The addRecord method prompts the user for an ID and a record, then adds this key-value pair to the table HashMap.
=>  A confirmation message is displayed to indicate that the record was successfully added.

6.Update Record:
private static void updateRecord(Scanner scanner) {
    int id = scanner.nextInt();
    scanner.nextLine();
    if (table.containsKey(id)) {
        String newRecord = scanner.nextLine();
        table.put(id, newRecord);
    }
Explanation:
=>  The updateRecord method first checks if the ID exists in the table.
=>  If it exists, the record is updated with new data provided by the user.
=>  A confirmation message is shown, or an error message if the ID doesn’t exist.

7. Delete Record:
private static void deleteRecord(Scanner scanner) {
    int id = scanner.nextInt();
    scanner.nextLine();
    if (table.remove(id) != null) {
        System.out.println("Record deleted successfully.");
    }
Explanation:
=>  The deleteRecord method attempts to remove a record by its ID.
=>  If the record exists and is deleted, a success message is displayed; otherwise, an =>  error message is shown.

8. Get Record:
private static void getRecord(Scanner scanner) {
    int id = scanner.nextInt();
    scanner.nextLine();
    System.out.println("Record: " + table.getOrDefault(id, "Record with ID " + id + " not found."));

Explanation:
=>  The getRecord method retrieves and displays a record by its ID.
=>  If the ID does not exist, a "not found" message is shown.

9. Loop Termination:
} while (choice != 5);
scanner.close();

Explanation:
=>  The loop continues until the user selects the 'Exit' option (choice 5).
=>  The scanner.close() statement ensures that the Scanner resource is properly closed.

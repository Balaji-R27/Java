7.1 Boxing and un-boxing

Boxing or autoboxing in Java is the process by which a primitive data type is converted into an object of the matching wrapper class. It converts boolean, byte, char, short, Int, long, float and double data types into their respective
wrapper class objects.

public static void main(String args[])
{
int a=40;
Integer b2=new Integer (a);

System.out.println(b2+b3);

7.2 Garbage Collection and Finalize
X
i) Garbage Collection
The term garbage refers to unreferenced objects in Java.
...
Garbage collection is the procedure of automatically recovering the unused runtime memory. The process gets rid of all unwanted objects. Garbage collection occurs during a program life cycle, effectively minimizing the necessity of memory de-allocation. This process helps to reduce memory leak possibilities. De-allocating memory also reduces the chances of programs crashing.
